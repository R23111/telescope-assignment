### Note on Docker base image:
> his project uses `python:3.11-slim` as the base image. While this image may show known vulnerabilities via automated scanners (e.g. Docker DX), it was chosen for its lightweight size and speed for prototyping. In a production environment, a more hardened image (such as one with pinned Debian versions or using distroless) should be considered.
